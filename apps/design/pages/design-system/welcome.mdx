## Yes, but what is a design system?

A design system is a **collection of pre-built, reusable assets**, such as components, patterns, guidance, and code, that enables designers, developers and content designers to create consistent digital experiences more efficiently.

Our design system **simplifies the design and development process** by providing pre-built and universal assets. This minimizes the time spent on building basic elements and allows team to focus on the product for use cases.

## Yes, but do I need a design system?

**Yep, if you’re part of a cross-functional team** as a designer, a developer, a content designer, a marketer or a product manager.

Let’s forge together an outstanding user journey for everyone that will experience your design: that's where our design system shines.
