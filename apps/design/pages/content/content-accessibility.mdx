# Content accessibility

We at **Fucina** give you all the tools to create **design products for everyone**. That means all the people can use your product and feel welcome, understood and valued. Here’s how.

## POUR principle

We follow the [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/#standards) that are driven by four principles:

- **[Perceivable](#perceivable)**
- **[Operable](#operable)**
- **[Understandable](#understandable)**
- **[Robust](#robust)**

### Perceivable

All users will be able to **perceive the information** presented in your design - with all of their senses.

That means a large use of **empathy**. Also, keep in mind that people **will read your content on screen** - seems obvious, but sometimes it’s not. Timing, colors, size, spacing and a lot of other aspects are essential.

Take care of each of them - some users can’t see or hear, have low vision or are color blind. **All the people need to have access to your content 💞**.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Use captions and subtitles for videos.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Don’t publish videos without context, subtitles or saying who is talking.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Make sure your [links are meaningful and precise](), and stand out from the text.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Avoid generic links as [click here]().
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Keep in mind that **font face, size and weight** should be nice and readable.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Avoid fonts that are cute but hard to read.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    **Be careful with the emojis** - they can add value but the sentence must be readable without them
    (example: “What a nice unicorn! 🦄”).
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Do not use an emoji in place of a word (example: “What a nice 🦄!”).
  </Alert>
</div>

### Operable

All users will be able to **operate your interface**: content must be meaningful and navigation must be simple.
Keep in mind that the experience shouldn’t require too much effort and users should have **enough time to read** what you’re telling them.
Use **Fucina** components and follow these principles:

- When you write your content, think about **how much time a person would take to read it** and match it with the timing on screen: is it enough?
- Consider **splitting your content** in different paragraphs, web pages or app screens in order to be more clear
- **Make accessible forms**: make sure labels are meaningful and they persist during the navigation inside the field, take extra care to [error messages]()

### Understandable

Users need to **understand and memorize your content** easily.
Focus people attention, keep it short and simple and, if you need to go deeper, use a meaningful **information hierarchy**.

Follow **Fucina** do’s and dont’s to design a fully understandable product.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Try to keep your sentences up to **20 words** long.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Do not write long sentences without using paragraphs, spacing, headers or bullet points.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Try to always **read your content out loud**: how does it sound? Good? Some users will hear it - and even
    those who will read it, they will appreciate your effort to make it more clear.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Don’t presume that it doesn’t matter if the content is long, because people can skip it: put more effort
    so they can put none.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    **Imagine that you’re writing for a kid**, in terms of readability: [WCAG
    guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reading-level.html) suggest us to aim to lower
    secondary education level - our [readability guideline](#readability) show you how.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Avoid complex words and chose simpler ones when possible.
  </Alert>
</div>

### Robust

Make **your content suitable for all devices and assistive technologies**: users and technologies keep evolving but your content needs to remain accessible.

Test your product to see if every aspect of your content is good for different browsers, devices and if it’s good to be read by assistive technologies.

## Readability

We at **Fucina** help you write **compelling yet simple and accessible content**.
Keep these two goals in mind. Readability plays a huge role. Your content should be accessible to people from 9 to 15 years old. And it’s **good for everyone**:

- It’s easier to understand by non-native speakers
- It’s easier to be heard by people who need assistive technologies
- It’s easier for neurodivergent people
- It’s easier for people in a rush, on the bus, tired and so on

Let’s do it, then.

### Keep it short and simple

**Short sentences** are good for all devices: remember that users are **_screen readers_**.
We need our content to be **short and sweet**.

Moreover, let’s consider:

- **Personal conditions**
- **External context** (space and time, such as being outdoor, on the bus, with other people around, or in a rush)
- **Different states of mind** (curious, anxious, worried, impatient…)

#### Up to 20 words

Keep your sentences **up to 20 words**

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    We’ve being doing this for 20 years so we are trained to be your assistants. (15 words)
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Our deep experience of the complex and diverse maket has granted us to be the best player in town to offer
    our clients the best assistance they need. (28 words)
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Shorter synonym

When in doubt, **chose a shorter synonym**

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Use
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Utilize
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Unnecessary words

**Avoid unnecessary words** and be careful with **prepositions**

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Now
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    At the moment
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    We offer you an experience
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    We intend to offer you an experience
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Concrete and precise

Be **concrete and precise**, avoid vague expressions: people are more and more surrounded by **“empty words”** and do not pay attention

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Our product is 100% organic cotton and has a three-year warranty.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Our product is innovative, competitive, efficient, unique, reliable and has extraordinary features.
  </Alert>
</div>

### Use plain language

Plain language is the **shortest, most accurate and efficient way** to pass information.
That means choosing the information that users need and putting it in the right way.

That’s **ordinary language**, very close to the spoken language, and it’s not unprofessional writing.

Users need to feel understood and guided. Your content must do that.

#### Don’t be robotic

**Don’t be robotic**: your content speaks as a human being

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Something went wrong
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Error detected
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Active verbs

**Use active verbs** and keep it conversational: active voice makes it clear who needs to do what and leave no ambiguity about who is responsible for an action.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Create a new password
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    A new password is required
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Pay now
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Payment needed
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Sentence case

**Write in sentence case**. Use capital letters only for proper nouns and for the first word. That makes your content scannable and easier to read

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Fill the form
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Fill the Form
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    How to reach new clients
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    How to reach New Clients
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Simple words

Always prefer simple words (they’re quite often the shorter ones too)

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Help
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Assistance
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Need
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Necessitate
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Before
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Previously
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Nominalizations

**Avoid nominalizations** (verbs that becomes nouns)

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    To finalize your account
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    In order to proceed with the finalization of your account
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Your must apply for this feature
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    You must make an application for this feature
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Conversational

**Conversational** is always better.
Headings are part of the conversation with your audience as well. Make clear why is important for them to do the things you’re telling them to do. That’s the case you need to work with balance between keeping it short and being exhaustive at the same time.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Sign these documents to secure your account even better
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Important! Signature needed
  </Alert>
</div>

### Organize the information

**Think about the people, always.**

_What do they need? What do they think when using your product? What’s their emotional status? Are they looking for answers? Are they experiencing trouble? Are they relaxed?_

#### Chose the main information

We tend to write the way we think, keeping our background and our goals in mind. We might confuse the readers because we put the key point at the end of our paragraph. Let’s **move it up front** and be clear about what we want them to do or know.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Upload your documents way sooner than the due date.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    In order to avoid delays due to server overload, **you shouldn’t upload your documents too much close to
    the due date**.
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Keep it easy to follow

People want answers and they hate loosing their time: who doesn’t?
Let’s guide them with our content.
Use chronological order and bullet points to better process information.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Three steps to open your bank account: 1. Upload your ID (your passport is fine!) 2. Take a picture of
    yourself 3. Fill the form with your contact information
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Opening your new bank account is easy! First you need to upload and ID document (your passport is fine as
    well), then take a picture of yourself and last but not least remember to fill the form with your contact
    information.
  </Alert>
</div>

### Design for readers

Content design helps people with their everyday tasks.
Do not forget that: we need to be helpful and make their life easier. Let’s put more effort in our content so they can put none.

#### Use headlines

Who’s afraid of walls of text? Everyone.
Even if they’re small walls.
Use headlines and spacing to provide clear content.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    **Here are your examples**: - **Use headlines** They focus the attention - **Use spacing** They make
    people read better
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Explaining that walls of text don’t work is useless if we don’t make examples. That’s why we are writing
    this paragraph and we are showing you how to write. Use headlines and spacing because that way it would be
    easier.
  </Alert>
</div>

#### Use formatting wisely

- **Be bold** when you want to emphasize something.
- Do not [underline it]() if it's not a [link](). It confuses people.
- Use _italic_ mainly when you're quoting someone.
- CAPS LOCK IS TOO LOUD FOR LONG SENTENCES.
- **BOLD CAPS LOCK IS WAY TOO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING**.

Use these tools wisely: they are made to stand out information, keep the rhythm, make it easy to follow. If we abuse them, they won’t work anymore.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    The exhibition is designed **for grownups and children** and it will be great for you to experience it
    from different points of view.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    **The exhibition is designed for grownups and children** and it will be great for you **to experience it
    from different points of view**.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    HERE’S YOUR E-TICKET You just need to show it at the entrance.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    HERE’S YOUR E-TICKET YOU JUST NEED TO SHOW IT AT THE ENTRANCE.
  </Alert>
</div>

### Readability scores

Let some tool help us write more clearly. [Readable](https://readable.com/) is one of them. It tells you **how easy to read your text is**. Use it to test.
Just remember that a tool can help you noticing things, but the best way to be readable is to keep in mind that people will need to understand what you’re telling them.

To sum up:

- **Read the room**. Be in your audience mind.
- **Guide people**. Help them understand. Moreover, keeping things easy for them will lead to your goals more quickly.
- **Organize the information**, make it clear for yourself before writingg
- **Always prefer simple language** and the easier alternative
- **Keep your sentences short**.
- **Use every kind of formatting** to help you design better content
- **Read your content out loud** before submitting it. That’s the very first step for readability. Listen how it sounds: can you read it easily? Does it sound like a human being or a robot? Can you breathe easily between sentences?

## Alt-text

Alternative text **describes the images you use in your content** on a website to explain them and to give context.
Alt text is essential for accessibility because **it is read aloud by screen readers**.
Moreover, it displays on page if the image fails to load and it’s indexed by search engines.

### Ask yourself the good questions

- What’s the point of that image?
- What is its added value to your content?
- Why is there?

Always remember to keep your content conversational and be specific about the description:

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Paying with xyz credit card makes it easier, you can do it in a bit like the woman in the picture is doing
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Woman paying with a credit card
  </Alert>
</div>

### Describe and be concrete

Don’t be vague and don’t fill the alt text with keywords for the search engines: alt text is indexed but it has the **main purpose to guide people**. Always write for them.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Cardless payments make your day flawless: you can use your phone like the woman in this picture
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Credit card online banking cardless payments
  </Alert>
</div>
