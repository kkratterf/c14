# Inclusive language

Inclusive language is free from words, phrases, or tones that reflect prejudiced, stereotyped or discriminatory views of particular people.

## Intro

Inclusive language became a thing – but we like to call it **open language**: _making content accessible is not enough in this foundry_.

- **Representation** matters.
- **Diversity** matters.
- **Being kind** matters.

We can value all these things with a language that makes everyone feel part of a huge human community.

Let's start crafting some exceptional and open content with our words, **for everyone**, based on a deep sense of respect.

## Make questions great again

We all have a bunch of **biases**. That's fine. Most of them come from our various **privileges**. And that's fine too. Being white, being a man, being an able person, being whealthy: have we chosen those things? Nope. But we can do something with them. Bye bye shame, **welcome responsibility**.

As designers, **we are all responsible for how our biases impact the way we design digital products**. Let's ask ourselves if our design choices come from our comfort zones or not. If so, don't be afraid to change.

Let's talk to other people, let them speak about what they need, what makes them feel unheard or misrepresented. Let's make questions great again and let's make our design process **a truly collective work**.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Start from the beginning: your **welcome messages** should be as open as possible.

    *“Hi everyone” “Hello there” “Hi folks”*

  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    Don’t assume that slang is good, **avoid gendered greetings**.

    *“Hi guys” “Hello bro” “Hello ladies and gentlemen”*

  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Questioning the way we talk to people and about people is a journey: **don’t be scared and be kind with
    yourself and others while learning**. People just want to be heard: being open and listen to other’s needs
    takes patience from both sides.
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    **Don’t let the discomfort discourage you**: working on our words to make reality better for everyone is
    an ongoing exercise and it’s important. It has nothing to do with a whim. Use your discomfort with
    empathy.
  </Alert>

## Gender

Talking about representation, we know that gender is an important part of our identity.

Do not assume the gender of the people that will use your design product: **being misrepresented** is not a nice thing. And, moreover, it is not something that builds trust nor makes people want to buy something.

When possible, use **gender neutral language**.

**Different languages** work in different ways, so be sure to **check** each of them.

<div className="mt-8 grid w-full grid-cols-1 gap-x-3 gap-y-5 sm:grid-cols-2">
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    “Want to make it a present for a friend? **Give us the address**”

    If you want or want to be more specific, in English you can use the pronoun “**they/their**”

  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    “Want to make it a present for a friend? **Give us his/her address**”
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
    Try not to ask too many details in your product user experience. If it’s useful to do so, **use an inclusive list of pronouns**:

    - Prefer not to respond
    - She/her
    - He/him
    - They/them
    - Prefer to specify

  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    **Don’t use a binary option of pronouns**: you can make people feel misrepresented.

    - She/her
    - He/him

  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💚 DO" className="alert-success">
      If you’re unsure about how many options to offer, **use “other” with another option**: “Non-binary / other”
  </Alert>
  <Alert title="💔 DON'T" variant="danger">
    **Don’t use “other” alone**, it may communicate that what doesn’t fit in the options is just “well, other”.
  </Alert>
</div>
